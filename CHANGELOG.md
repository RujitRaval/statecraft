# Changelog

All notable changes to Statecraft will be documented in this file.

This project uses the four-part version format required by the GStack ship workflow.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Statecraft now has a reproducible pnpm workspace with strict TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, and native ESM build tooling.
- The initial private `@statecraft/core` package establishes a clean build and export boundary for Phase 2 contracts.
- Local and hosted checks now verify dependency installation, linting, type safety, tests, documentation, package exports, and builds.

### Changed

- Development now targets Node.js 22.20 or newer within the Node 22 line, or Node.js 24 and newer.
- Dependency installs now use exact versions, an integrity-pinned package manager, strict engine and peer checks, and a one-day release quarantine.
- Contributor documentation now describes the implemented Phase 1 foundation and keeps later packages out of scope until their development phases begin.

## [0.0.1.0] - 2026-08-19

### For contributors

- Contributors and coding agents now follow a documented branch and pull request workflow with GStack review and ship as required gates.
- Repository checks now catch missing or broken documentation and, once implementation starts, block missing or failing lint, typecheck, test, and build scripts.
- Pull requests now receive CodeQL analysis and dependency review, while Dependabot, code ownership, a pull request template, and security reporting guidance support ongoing maintenance.

### Changed

- The ignore policy now keeps local archives, credentials, reports, browser artifacts, caches, logs, editor files, and agent state out of the public repository.
- Repository entry points now keep implementation work inside the approved Phase 1 and Phase 2 boundary.
